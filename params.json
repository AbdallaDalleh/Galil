{"name":"Galil-3-0","tagline":"ASYN based EPICS driver for Galil products","body":"### Welcome\r\n\r\nThis software branch was sent to Galil for their own separate development on 20/11/2013.  The EPICS driver advertised and  supported by Galil should now be considered a separate branch and it's origins are from this software.  \r\n\r\nSince that time, this original branch has advanced significantly  \r\n\r\nThis driver has the following features:  \r\n\r\nA) Asyn model 3 architecture  \r\nB) Motor record support  \r\nC) Analog and Digital IO  \r\nD) Output TTL pulses for closed-loop motor delta distance  (ie. output compare)   \r\nE) Time based profile motion (Trajectories)   \r\nF) Coordinate system axes (eg. Slit width)   \r\nG) Deferred moves facility   \r\nH) Coordinated motion for up to 8 motors   \r\nI) Sophisticated connection management    \r\nJ) Fast update rates 8ms   \r\nK) Example MEDM screens     \r\nL) Example IOC  \r\nM) Autosave request files   \r\nN) RIO PLC supported   \r\nO) Intended to replace Galil EPICS 1-5 driver  \r\n\r\nThe driver is for linux runlevel 5, or windows.  \r\n\r\nThe Galil Communication Library (GCL) must be installed on the IOC to compile this software.  \r\nThe GCL is available for download on the Galil website:    \r\n\r\nhttp://www.galilmc.com/support/software-downloads.php\r\n\r\nAll motion modes specified work on the 21x3 controller or newer.     \r\n\r\nI hope you find this software useful :)  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
