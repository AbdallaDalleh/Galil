{"name":"Galil-3-0","tagline":"ASYN based EPICS driver for Galil products","body":"### Welcome\r\n\r\nThis software branch was sent to Galil for their own separate development on 20/11/2013.  The driver advertised and supported by Galil should now be considered a separate branch and it's origins are from this software.\r\n\r\nSince that time, this original branch has advanced significantly\r\n\r\nThe driver has the following features:  \r\n\r\nA) Asyn model 3 architecture  \r\nB) Motor record support  \r\nC) Analog and Digital IO  \r\nD) Output TTL pulses for closed-loop motor delta distance  (ie. output compare)   \r\nE) Time based profile motion (Trajectories)   \r\nF) Coordinate system axes (eg. Slit width)   \r\nG) Deferred moves facility   \r\nH) Coordinated motion for up to 8 motors   \r\nI) Sophisticated connection management    \r\nJ) Fast update rates 8ms   \r\nK) Example MEDM screens     \r\nL) Example IOC  \r\nM) Autosave request files   \r\nN) RIO PLC supported   \r\nO) Intended to replace Galil EPICS 1-5 driver  \r\n\r\nThe driver is for linux runlevel 5, or windows.  \r\n\r\nAll motion modes specified work on the 21x3 and upward.   \r\n\r\nI hope it is useful :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
