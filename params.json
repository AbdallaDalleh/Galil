The driver advertised and supported by Galil should now be considered a separate branch and it's origins are from this software.\r\n\r\nSince that time, this original branch has advanced significantly\r\n\r\nThe driver has the following features:  \r\n\r\nA) Asyn model 3 architecture  \r\nB) Motor record support  \r\nC) Analog and Digital IO  \r\nD) Output TTL pulses for servo motor delta distance  \r\nE) Time based profile motion (Trajectories)   \r\nF) Coordinate system axes (eg. Slit width)   \r\nG) Deferred moves facility   \r\nH) Coordinated motion for up to 8 motors   \r\nI) Sophisticated connection management    \r\nJ) Fast update rates 8ms   \r\nK) Example MEDM screens     \r\nL) Example IOC  \r\nM) Autosave request files   \r\nN) Intended to replace Galil EPICS 1-5 driver\r\n\r\nThe driver is for linux runlevel 5, or windows\r\n\r\nI hope it is useful :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
